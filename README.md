# Reflection

- The project is built for my client whose requirement was to have a blogging website for himself.
- I saw a perfect opportunity to hone my skills in the MERN stack. 
- It is a beautiful learning experience. Through this I have learned very important concepts of React Js, Node Js, Express Js and Mongo Db.

# Future Scope
  
- As of now the frontend and the api has been completed.
- The next immediate action is to connect frontend and backend.
- In future, It will also have a multi user platform with the Admin approving the registration.
